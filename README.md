The **IoT Data Generator** is a Python-based application that simulates IoT device behavior by generating synthetic sensor data. This tool is ideal for testing IoT systems, cloud services, or data pipelines.

## Features
- Simulates multiple IoT devices.
- Generates realistic sensor data (temperature, humidity, GPS).
- Adjustable data generation frequency.
- Outputs data in JSON format (can be extended to send data to APIs, MQTT brokers, or cloud platforms).
